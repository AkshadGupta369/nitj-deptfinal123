        Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a crucial role in fostering economic growth and employment opportunities. These enterprises, characterized by their relatively smaller scale of operations, contribute significantly to innovation, entrepreneurship, and inclusive development. MSMEs encompass a diverse range of industries, from manufacturing to services, and serve as the backbone of many economies worldwide. Governments often implement policies and initiatives to support the growth of MSMEs, recognizing their vital role in driving economic prosperity and sustainability.
